		// If you have more than two ban points, then you are blocked from joining any games until the penalty is up

			// The AmongUsClient::CoStartGame coroutine does a lot of things, and waits for a lot of events, before awarding any ban points
			// AmongUsClient::CoStartGame runs and awaits the AmongUsClient::CoStartGameClient or AmongUsClient::CoStartGameHost coroutines, depending on if the client is the host of the lobby or not
			// AmongUsClient::CoStartGameClient first waits for the host to despawn the lobby and spawn in an instance of the map within fifteen or twenty seconds
			// If the timer is up and none of those criteria have been met, then the client disconnects
			// Otherwise, the client sends a ClientReady game message to notify the host that it has loaded in the map
			// The client then waits for all other players to send the ClientReady game message within the same time period as before
			// If not all clients have readied up by the timer, then the client disconnects
			// Otherwise, the client then waits for tasks and a role to be assigned to the player. This has no associated timeout.
			// Once all of these checks are done, the AmongUsClient::CoStartGameClient finishes and returns execution back to AmongUsClient::CoStartGame
			// Afterwards, the AmongUsClient::CoStartGame coroutine finally awards a ban point to the player
			// To get the AmongUsClient::CoStartGameClient coroutine to finish as fast as possible, we immediately despawn the lobby, spawn in a map, and assign tasks and roles to all players
			// Since we have sent 282 StartGame game messages, there are 282 AmongUsClient::CoStartGame coroutines running all at the same time
